As a DM
I see a summary of the selected player's statistics
So I know the current state of the active character

Tasks:

1. Make a panel appear in the flow of the page layed out beneath the character list
2. Enter static markup in the panel with a reasonable set of maximum data
3. Style the markup such that the labels and values appear in columns, with numbers right aligned, the HP stat should be emphasized
4. id the values so that they can be dynamically updated from javascript
5. implement a function such that given a set of key value pairs, the function can set the values to be associated with the correct HTML
6. Have javascript initialize the hash from a static action in the sinatra application which is passed back when the dm client connects
7. Have the characters all return identical hashes from a method call when the server calls for it
8. Store the basic attributes in the model, and have those values be dynamic based on which character is chosen
9. Write unit tests for each calculated value, given edge case inputs
10. Update the character hash generation method so that it uses the formulae to get the values

As a DM
I see the characters sorted by Initiative
So the turns execute in the correct order

As a DM
I see a graphic display of each character's ability in a check
So I can gauge the difficulty of an event
